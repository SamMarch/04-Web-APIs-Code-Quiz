# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

Your Task
At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment—perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

This week’s coursework will equip you with all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

# User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

I want to fufil all the critera mentioned above in a way that challenges me and pushes me to learn new things, with this in mind, the code i will use this time will be different to my previous projects, employing new syntax and requiring new research on my part.
